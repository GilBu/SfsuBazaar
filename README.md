# SFSU Bazzar

## Executive Summary

There are many storefront websites in today’s market ranging from Amazon,
Ebay, Craigslist, and to our very our SFSU Bookstore. However, what if we can take all
the benefits of these sites and bring them together into one cohesive website for everyone
at San Francisco State University? *SFSU Bazaar* will give users the ability to exchange
items and currency in person like Craigslist, but within the accessibility and security of
the San Francisco State campus.

With Craigslist’s convenience, Ebay’s selling system, with auctions and buy
nows, and Amazon’s beautiful design and streamlined method of showing products to
customers, *SFSU Bazaar* will be a website that caters to the needs of students of San
Francisco State University. It will provide a platform that gives a safe human interaction
between the seller and buyer. To further the ease of trading and selling we will have the
customer’s major information and class textbook and supplies listed so, with a simple
filter, the customer can find all of the textbooks and supplies he or she need for a class.
With the information of what the buyer has bought and his or her major we can highlight
other products he or she might wish to buy based on the classes he or she had, along with
other products they have bought in the past. With this information we can gain insight
into correlating products to majors and classes, so we can advertise more products to
them.

## Use Cases

- Joseph is an incoming Freshman, who forgot to buy his textbooks before the first
day of class! His teacher says that they’re going to have a quiz on Chapter One during
their next class, but the bookstore is out of stock on that particular textbook. What’s
worse, is that Amazon won’t be able to get it to him for at least a few more days! Joseph
decides to check to see if anyone on campus has a copy of his textbook from a past
semester, and finds a Junior who’s trying to get rid of his old supplies. Joseph buys the
textbook, and arranges to meet the Junior later that day. The two of them meet on
campus, and the transaction is made. Unfortunately, Joseph puts his studying off until the
last minute, and still fails the quiz.

- New edition of textbook that doesn’t have much significant changes but costs
more so teacher posts previous edition of the textbook on the website for students to
purchase. Students are failing their classes because they refuse to buy the textbook due to
the price. Teacher begin to look bad and comes up with the idea of selling old edition
textbook to his students from previous semesters. Teacher makes profit from this and
students aren’t failing while also happy that they don’t have to sell a kidney or their blood
for a semester’s worth of textbooks.

- Dilbert is an employee in [COMPANY NAME GOES HERE]’s corporate office,
and has recently been assigned to the administrative team managing their web service.
After gaining all of the proper permissions for his account, Dilbert goes about checking
on the site. A couple of spammers are posting on the site, so he bans them and deletes the
posts considered to be spam. Then Dilbert encounters a user that posted inappropriate
item, so Dilbert swiftly removed the post and messaged and issued a warning to the user.
Due to the fact Dilbert has been doing a great job managing the site his boss bought him
donuts.
